                <h2 style="text-align:center" id="demotext" class="font4">Aydin Thill aka Ay Din is a student at the DAB SRH Hochschule für Kommunikation und Design. Every spare-minute that he gets, he puts into the development of his music. His goal is to improve himself equally in both domains, graphic design and music production.<br>

                <h2 style="text-align:center" id="demotext" class="font4">This doesn't come from anywhere: Back in the days, his father founded an advertising agency, which he directed for over two decades. His mother on the other hand is a piano teacher. Aydin also went to the Conservatoire de Luxembourg for 11 Years and learned to play drums, percussion, and especially Jazz Vibraphone. He then decided to quit the conservatoire and dedicated his time to the mastery of music and sound production. Till then, one of his biggest accomplishments is the music production for a television spot for "Fachmaart Robert Steinhäuser", which was broadcasted on cinema and television across whole Luxemburg.
                Apart from this, he does logos, posters, and other design-related projects for friends, acquaintances, and also himself.
